Option 1: <== DO THIS

- start with empty page, just Add textbox
- set number of cards allowed to # specified in Countries.txt (because has all the data for a card)
- Add textbox ("Enter country"): 
	- should be submit type entry
	- include list of valid countries. Need pull-down list?
	- Return or Enter kicks off process
		- verify entry is valid (i.e. in list from Countries.txt, countryData dictionary)
			- actually might not need if do select list built from countryData
			- how to check if key exists in object
			- throw error if wrong
		- verify don't have too many cards (error if current # of cards EQ # countries in countryData, IOW # keys)
			- throw error if yes
		- need to check data entry validation techniques from previous lessons
		- locate country in countryData (dictionary)
		- Build the data object (like countries.baseCountry[x])
		- Render data object into html using Mustache
		- Append the html to the card deck
		- set up the dismiss button response
	- 
- Move guts of BuildMustacheData function into new function: BuildCardDAta (countryData object) - DONE

- Remove isBase field from code & Countries file - DONE



- Modify mustache template to remove outer loop. Only need outer decorations & inner loop

Plan of Attack:

1. Add "add" stuff & JS to make it work (i.e. get data into browser)
	- see PBS32 on how to make a DOM-built select list
	- have error block to display errors. 
2. Remove current add card stuff, so initially page is empty
3. Create BuildCardData
4. Create click function for Add select list to make card, render it, & display it
4a. Remove array 'countries'. Rename 'countriesX'
4b. Remove array 'RATES', Rename 'RATESx'
4c. Remove isbase field
4d. Clear error on next Add button click
4e. remove unused functions & vars
4f. put date into card
4g. comment out debug console logs

all above done

5. Test all error conditions
	- bad country, country not found in ECB data
	- flag image failure (error in console log, catch error?)
	- URL/AJAX failure
	- no template file
	- no country data file
	- too many cards
	
6. add country long name to country data - DONE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Extra Credit:

Add ability to select which countries are displayed

1. Use Bootstrap checkboxes.
2. List of countries comes from country DB
3. User selects countries before adding card
	a. Error if add card before select country
4. Card will only contain those countries selected
5. Allow an indefinite number of countries to select.
6. Add a clear selection button. - DONE
7. Add a select all - DONE
8. Selection rules:
	a. If check a new box, just add to dictionary
	b. If clear a box, remove it from dictionary
